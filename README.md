# Build A BSD

License: 2-Clause BSD License
Language: /bin/sh on HardenedBSD

This collection of scripts provides automation for installing a
customized, templated BSD installation onto a physical medium. This
repo is meant to be ran from an mfsBSD-based solution, like SoloBSD.

While support for multiple BSDs is planned, only HardenedBSD is
supported at the moment.

Boot from an mfsBSD, download this repo, untar it, and run
`bin/bab.sh` as root.
